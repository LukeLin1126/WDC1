    <h1>Check out my borders</h1>

    <p>We,ve modified the content div to have a 1px darkgrey border with rounded corners of an 8px radius.
        <br />Other elements can have borders too,
        <span class = "red-border">like this span with the class red-border.</span>
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>You can change the color of horizontal rules by changing the border color;
        <br />all horizontal rules are now #CFDFE4.
    </p>
    <p>Alternately,<span class = "red-outline">this span has a red outline (red-outline class).</span><br />
        That prevents it fron messing with the line height.</p>
</div>
<p>Notice how the borders double up here:<br />
<div class = "red-border">
    <p>This div has a red border</p>
</div>
<div class = "div_2">
    <p>This div has a blue border</p>
</div>
<p>Notice how this fixes the borders:</p>
<div class = "div_3">
    <p>This div has a red border, except on the bottom, and 8px round top corners</p>
</div>
<div class = "div_4">
    <p>This div has a blue border, and 8px round bottom corners</p>
</div>
