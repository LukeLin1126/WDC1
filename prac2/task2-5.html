    <h1>
        A page with some divs and spans
    </h1>

    <p>
        This page looks much cleaner now that I've put my content in a div with a white background.
    </p>

    <P>
        Because this div is special, it have it's own id, "context".
        <br>
        This allows us to differentiate it from other divs and give it a white background.
    </P>

    <hr>

    <p>
        This is a normal paragraph, expect <span class="blue">this span of text is blue</span>
        <span class="fancy">and this span has a font-family of cursive,</span>
        <br>
        because they belongs to two classes called "blue" and "fancy" respectively.
    </p>

    <p>
        On the other hand, <span class="fancy blue">this span of text is both blue and fancy!</span>
    </p>
</div>


<div>This text is inside a normal div, but the background has not been set.</div>
